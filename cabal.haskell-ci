  -- The following is silently ignored here:

  -- raw-project
  --   allow-newer: bytestring
  --
  -- Cannot build tests with newer bytestring because doctest-parallel relies on non-upgradeable ghc library
  --
  -- tests: True
  -- run-tests: True

-- The following is meant to be for constraint-set bytestring-0.12 only,
-- but there is currently no way to enable `allow-newer: bytestring`
-- just for the constraint set.
--
-- Since core library `bytestring` is constrained to `installed`,
-- it is not harmful to allow newer `bytestring` in the default runs
-- as well---it will have no effect there.
